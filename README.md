# Devastate

Calibrate your uncertainty at https://fasiha.github.io/devastate/

Check out my predicted-vs-actual plot and tell me how to be more risk-on:

![My results](./me.png)

- 55% ➜ 75.0% = 9/12
- 65% ➜ 100.0% = 6/6
- 75% ➜ 100.0% = 4/4
- 85% ➜ 87.5% = 7/8
- 95% ➜ 100.0% = 10/10

## Reading
- Seriously, go read Julia Galef's *The Scout Mindset*. I found out about it from Dan Luu's post, ["Cocktail ideas"](https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/). Luu [tweeted](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1477789639423320064), "There are 6 blog posts that were on my to-do list that I think I don't need to write anymore since the book describes what I wanted to describe, but better than I would've done it."
- I also liked *Superforecasting* (Tetlock and Gardner) and *Everything is Obvious (Once You Know the Answer)* (Duncan Watts).
- Umm, you might like my blog post about calibrating your subjective feeling about a probability via my Texas hold 'em app? ["Learning about risk, for kids and grownups"](https://fasiha.github.io/post/risk-for-kids-and-grownups/) (this isn't mentioned on the actual site)
- Since we're talking about reading that's maybe more ancillary: I loved Aaron Brown's *Poker Face of Wall Street* because it talks about uncertainty when it's forced down your throat by the world, i.e., when you don't have an app giving you probabilities and when you're not establishing your own subjective probabilities.
- I'm working through Annie Duke's *Thinking in Bets* too, which is probably really in line with uncertainty calibration.
